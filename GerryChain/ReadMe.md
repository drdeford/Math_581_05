In addition to the slides and materials on CoCalc, here are a few other resources for getting started with GerryChain:
* The documenation for the package itself is not too bad and contains an example of how to get running on Pennsylvania: https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain
* Additionally, I have compiled several templated here: https://github.com/drdeford/GerryChain-Templates that work on both grids and actual state data
* The following repo: https://github.com/vrdi/GerryChain-BootCamp contains tutorials from a week long boot camp on the software that I taught in 2019
* Finally, the extended .pdf documentation here: http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/ddeford/GerryChain_Guide.pdf is an attempt to provide a comprehensive description of the features of the package in a self-contained document with plenty of examples.
