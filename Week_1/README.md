# Week 1 Introduction to NetworkX and Overview

## What is a network?

Here are some relevant presentations I have given on the topic: 

* [Graphs and Networks](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/VRDI2019_NvG.pdf)
* [More than "just" networks](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/prospective_talk_2016.pdf)
* [Mathematical Modeling of Social Connections](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/DeFord_STS_Final.pdf)

## How does networkx work?
The python notebooks show some basic examples of the networkx syntax. We will work through these together on Google's CoCalc service.
